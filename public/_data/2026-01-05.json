      "fullSummary": "Google highlights Jules as an autonomous, asynchronous AI coding agent aimed at helping developers make progress on coding tasks without requiring constant, real-time prompting. The announcement positions Jules as a “build with” assistant that can take on work in the background, supporting developer workflows and reducing the overhead of manual iteration. The post frames Jules within Google Labs’ experimentation around practical AI tools for software creation and collaboration.",

      "fullSummary": "Anthropic announces Claude Opus 4 and Claude Sonnet 4 as its next-generation models, emphasizing improvements in coding performance, advanced reasoning, and AI agent workflows. The release includes “extended thinking with tool use” (beta), enabling the models to alternate between reasoning and tools like web search, plus parallel tool use and more precise instruction following. Anthropic also expands developer tooling: Claude Code becomes generally available with GitHub Actions support and integrations for VS Code and JetBrains, and the API gains new capabilities including a code execution tool, an MCP connector, a Files API, and prompt caching for up to one hour. Both models are described as hybrid, offering near-instant responses as well as a deeper extended-thinking mode, with availability across Claude plans and Sonnet 4 also offered to free users.",

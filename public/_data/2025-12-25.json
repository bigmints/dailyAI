            "shortDescription": "OpenAI launches its native 'Atlas' browser and a specialized Codex model for autonomous programming tasks.",
            "fullSummary": "OpenAI has officially released GPT-5.2-Codex, a model specifically optimized for long-horizon engineering tasks and agentic tool-calling. Alongside the model, the company launched 'ChatGPT Atlas,' a native web browser designed to allow AI agents to navigate the web, manage company knowledge, and execute actions directly within a secure browsing environment. This release signals a transition from simple chat interfaces to 'super agents' that can orchestrate complex workflows across multiple platforms autonomously.",

            "fullSummary": "The partnership between Figma and Qt has reached a milestone with the launch of 'Figma to Qt,' a tool that translates design tokens and Auto Layout structures directly into production-ready FlexboxLayout and QML code. Unlike static exports, this system creates functional UI components like buttons and switches that maintain their logic and interactivity. It includes a live preview mode where designers can validate multi-screen experiences as real graphical user interfaces in the browser before handing them off to engineers.",

            "fullSummary": "Google has demoed 'Disco,' an AI-driven system that allows users to 'remix' their open search tabs into a cohesive, interactive web application. Instead of flipping between tabs, Disco synthesizes the data and tools found across various websites into a custom UI tailored to the user's current goal, such as trip planning or project management. This represents one of Google's most radical shifts in search UI, moving away from a list of links toward a generative, app-like experience.",

            "fullSummary": "The AI landscape is shifting toward physical infrastructure dominance with the announcement of 'Stargate,' a $500 billion initiative by OpenAI, SoftBank, and Oracle to secure long-term compute and energy. Simultaneously, Microsoft and OpenAI have finalized a restructuring deal that allows OpenAI to seek independent infrastructure partnerships while granting Microsoft 27% equity and continued IP rights until 2032. This decoupling allows both giants to pursue separate hardware and consumer device strategies, fundamentally changing the competitive landscape for 2026.",
